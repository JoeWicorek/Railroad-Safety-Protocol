# Railroad Safety-Protocol App
This project investigates railroad safety protocols, focusing on understanding the trends, challenges, and potential areas for improvement. By analyzing historical data, visualizing trends, and examining the impact of various safety measures, the project aims to contribute to a safer and more efficient railway system.

🚦 Project Overview
Railroads are a critical component of transportation infrastructure, but they come with significant safety challenges. This project explores:

Accident trends and their causes.
The effectiveness of implemented safety protocols.
Recommendations for enhancing railway safety based on data-driven insights.

📊 Features
Data Analysis:

Comprehensive review of accident reports and railway safety metrics.
Identification of key trends and areas of concern.
Visualizations:

Interactive graphs and charts showcasing safety trends over time.
Geographic distribution of incidents for better spatial understanding.
Impact Assessment:

Evaluation of implemented safety protocols and their effectiveness.
Insights into areas where safety measures can be improved.

🔍 Key Findings
Accident Trends:

A decline in incidents related to equipment failure, but human error remains a significant factor.
Seasonal patterns in accidents suggest environmental influences.
Geographic Insights:

Specific regions experience higher accident rates, correlating with traffic density and infrastructure quality.
Safety Protocol Effectiveness:

Some protocols have reduced specific types of incidents, but gaps remain in addressing human error.
